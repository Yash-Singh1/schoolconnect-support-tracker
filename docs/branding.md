# Branding Guidelines

This document is a guide to the branding and color palette of SchoolConnect. We created this document to allow others to use the SchoolConnect brand without having to negotiate legal agreements with us. If you have any questions, create a discussion on the SchoolConnect [forum](https://github.com/Yash-Singh1/schoolconnect-support-tracker/discussions) or contact us at schoolconnect at yashsingh.us.

## Icons

The SchoolConnect icon is a modified version of the splashscreen icon that consists of two puzzle pieces in contrasting colors interlocked together. The icon is available in a PNG file format (500x500):

![SchoolConnect Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Yash-Singh1/schoolconnect-support-tracker/main/docs/assets/logo.png)

You are permitted to use the icon in your project, and modify the background color within a reasonable range of the current one. The icon is used whenever a square image icon is required such as a favicon or an app icon.

The splashscreen icon is similar, however the puzzle pieces aren't interlocking and it is available only in a wide format. The splashscreen icon is available in a PNG file format (1910x1076):

The font used in the splashscreen icon is [Virgil](https://virgil.excalidraw.com/), the font that powers Excalidraw.

As with the previous icon, you are permitted to use the splashscreen icon in your project, and modify the background color within a reasonable range of the current one. The splashscreen icon is used whenever a wide image icon is required such as a splashscreen or a slideshow as the main picture.
